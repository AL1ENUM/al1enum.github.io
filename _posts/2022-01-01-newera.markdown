#### Thoughts 

The 2021 was full of knowledge and learning, every evolution brings changes. 
As alienum i realized that i lost my motivation for CTFs. 
Now im ready to deep dive in new things that i never had done in cyber security. 
I will create a new branch in the tree of my path in cyber security.


#### VM Creation

The creation of machines will not stop but the frequency of creation will be reduced.

~ Quantity is the opposite of quality. Time-driven

#### First Steps & New Goals

I plan to create a new name, over alienum, where it will represent a way of thinking in the world of cybersecurity. 
I will create a gitbook where it will present my work from a professional point of view.

#### Contents

- PowerShell for Pentesters
- Information Gathering / OSINT
- Red Teaming / Active Directory
- Web App Exploitation
- Programs and Scripts related to Cyber Security
- Post Exploitation / Privileges Escalation 
- Many other things


I will upload a new post with the link of the new era ;)
